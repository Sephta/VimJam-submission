## Info
Coalescence is a game about collecting various different creatures and combining them to create new ones. Inspired by some of the original Digimon Virtual Pets back in the 90s, I want to create an interactable and fun way to re-experience the joy of discovering new and interesting "mons" with a slight twist.
